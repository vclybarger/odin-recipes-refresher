        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This pesto chicken caprese comes out wonderfully moist and flavorful. 
            Tomato slices add a nice acidity to the chicken breasts and melted 
            mozzarella on top is the perfect finish.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 (10- to 12-ounce) skinless boneless chicken breasts</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons basil pesto</li>
            <li>1 large beefsteak tomato, cut into four 1/4-inch thick slices </li>
            <li>8 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese, cut into 8 slices</li>
            <li>fresh basil leaves, torn</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Cut chicken breasts in half horizontally and, if needed, pound each to even thickness with a meat mallet. Season both sides with salt.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a 12-inch oven-proof skillet over medium heat. Add chicken to skillet and cook until lightly browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook the other side until lightly browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove skillet from heat.</li>
            <li>Spread 1 tablespoon of pesto on top of each chicken portion.</li>
            <li>Place 1 tomato slice on top of each chicken portion and top with 2 slices of mozzarella.</li>
            <li>Transfer skillet to the preheated oven and bake until cheese is melted and chicken is cooked through (165 degrees F or 74 degrees C), about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve topped with torn basil leaves.</li>
